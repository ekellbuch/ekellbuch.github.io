Transfer functions describe how a linear time-invariant (LTI) system transforms inputs into outputs. Transfer functions provide a compact, frequency-domain view of system dynamics, making it easy to analyze stability, and fundamental performance limits.

Outline:
- Why transfer functions are such a powerful abstraction.
- How zeros, poles, and factorizations shape system behavior.
- What "perfect tracking" means in both the time and frequency domains.
- Why non-minimum-phase systems fundamentally block perfect tracking.
- Visualizations and worked examples.
