I'm a Postdoctoral Scholar at Stanford University working with [Scott Linderman](https://web.stanford.edu/~swl1/) and [Christopher Ré](https://cs.stanford.edu/~chrismre/). My research focuses on building efficient and reliable systems for scientific discovery through machine learning and large language models.

I completed my PhD at Columbia University's [Center for Theoretical Neuroscience](https://ctn.zuckermaninstitute.columbia.edu/), where I worked with [Liam Paninski](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~liam/) and [John Cunningham](https://stat.columbia.edu/~cunningham/). I also spent time as a Student Researcher at Google, working with the Reliable Deep Learning team on evaluating the reliability of Large Language and Vision Models.

My research contributions include developing machine learning systems for functional imaging, pose estimation, and behavioral segmentation. This work has been adopted by organizations including Q-state Biosciences, the Internal Brain Laboratory, and the Zuckerman Institute.

I earned my BS and MS with Honors in Electrical Engineering from KU.
