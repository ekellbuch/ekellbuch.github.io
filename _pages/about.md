I'm a Postdoctoral Scholar at Stanford University working with [Scott Linderman](https://web.stanford.edu/~swl1/) and [Christopher Ré](https://cs.stanford.edu/~chrismre/). I’m interested in how we can build AI that amplifies humans, helping scientists, engineers, and domain experts think better, discover faster, and push the boundaries of what’s possible.

LLMs today are powerful, but fragile: they fail silently, misjudge their own outputs, and struggle with long-horizon tasks. I aim to address these challenges by developing the foundations of reliable agentic systems, focusing on efficient and reliable scalable reasoning.

Some of my recent projects include:

- [Terminal-Bench](https://www.tbench.ai/), a benchmark that offers realistic terminal environments for evaluating reasoning, planning and execution of agentic systems.

- Weaver [(Neurips 2025)](https://neurips.cc/virtual/2025/loc/san-diego/poster/117007), a scalable verification framework that fuses many weak but cost-efficient verifiers and LM judges to produce more reliable correctness signals, closing the generation–verification gap.

I completed my PhD at Columbia University's [Center for Theoretical Neuroscience](https://ctn.zuckermaninstitute.columbia.edu/), where I worked with [Liam Paninski](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~liam/) and [John Cunningham](https://stat.columbia.edu/~cunningham/). My doctoral research developed machine learning methods for neuroscience, including advances in processing functional imaging datasets, animal pose estimation, and unsupervised behavioral segmentation. This work has been adopted by organizations including Q-state Biosciences, the International Brain Laboratory, and the Zuckerman Institute.

I also spent time as a Student Researcher at Google, working with the Reliable Deep Learning team on evaluating the reliability of Large Language and Vision Models.

I earned my Bacherlo'S and MS with Honors in Electrical Engineering from KU.
