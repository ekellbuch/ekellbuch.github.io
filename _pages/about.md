I'm a Postdoctoral Scholar at Stanford University working with [Scott Linderman](https://web.stanford.edu/~swl1/) and [Christopher Ré](https://cs.stanford.edu/~chrismre/). I’m interested in building reliable and efficient AI systems that augment humans.

LLMs today are powerful, but fragile: they fail silently, misjudge their own outputs, and struggle with long-horizon tasks. I aim to address these challenges by developing the foundations of reliable agentic systems: systems that can recognize what they do/not know, can verify their own reasoning, remember what matters, and operate safely at scale.

Some of my recent projects include:

- Terminal-Bench [(Submitted, 2025)](https://www.tbench.ai/), a benchmark including realistic terminal environments for evaluating reasoning, planning and execution of agentic systems. It is now a defacto standard for evaluating open/closed- sourced foundation models.


- Weaver [(NeurIPS, 2025)](https://neurips.cc/virtual/2025/loc/san-diego/poster/117007), a scalable verification framework that fuses many weak but cost-efficient verifiers(including LM judges) into a unified correctness estimate, closing the generation–verification gap.

I completed my PhD at Columbia University's [Center for Theoretical Neuroscience](https://ctn.zuckermaninstitute.columbia.edu/), where I worked with [Liam Paninski](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~liam/) and [John Cunningham](https://stat.columbia.edu/~cunningham/). My doctoral research developed machine learning methods for neuroscience, including advances in processing functional imaging datasets, animal pose estimation, and unsupervised behavioral segmentation. This work has been adopted by organizations including [Q-state Biosciences](https://www.quiverbioscience.com/press), the [International Brain Laboratory](https://www.internationalbrainlab.com/), and the [Zuckerman Institute](https://zuckermaninstitute.columbia.edu/), among others.

I also spent time as a Student Researcher at Google on the Reliable Deep Learning team, focusing on evaluating the reliability of [large language and vision models](https://research.google/blog/towards-reliability-in-deep-learning-systems/).

I earned my Bacherlor's and Master's degrees with Honors in Electrical Engineering from the University of Kansas.
